CS 122B project. Fabflix by Mustafa Yesilyurt

This was a project I did for my undergraduate degree at UC Irvine. 

Note that none of the AWS instances are on, so testing the code is not possible, but there are several links to Youtube videos that demo the various functions of the code. Feel free to check them out!

Here are the links in order:
Project 1: https://youtu.be/ljfn_pm5oGQ <br>
Project 2: https://youtu.be/cFacsYlHPKE <br>
Project 3: https://youtu.be/AAnl_d9FUpI <br>
Project 4: https://youtu.be/cFYqSttesQ0 <br>
Project 5: https://youtu.be/CPMghbPXJzA <br>
Project 5 redux (a bit shorter): https://youtu.be/dndkXLzjbEE


Below are detailed descriptions or answers to questions that were required for the assignments.

Project 5:

YouTube link: https://youtu.be/CPMghbPXJzA
NOTE: This demo is 20 minutes and 22 seconds long and I stopped the third JMeter test at 4 minutes and 35 seconds because I was running out of time. The reason I took so long is because I spent time in the beginning showing that the repos were freshly cloned and using newly built war files. That wasn't explicitly required for this homework, but I did it anyway out of habit and it cost me. If you would like me to rerecord the demo to have it be shorter, I am open to doing that.
EDIT: I went ahead and rerecorded my project 5 demo. Here is the link: https://youtu.be/dndkXLzjbEE

Unfortunately, a lot of my time was spent trying to fix the problems the graders were having with my submission of Project 4, so I wasn't able to get to all 
of this in time. I am, however, on my way to finishing the last task. I hope I will also be able to find the persisting problem in my front end code. So far, I was able to remove
the "TypeError: t is not defined" error by reordering my script declarations (putting jquery before bootstrap did the trick) but I am still facing problems in that I am unable to
navigate to other pages. However, that doesn't really have any bearing on this assignment or the demo!

EDIT: have fixed that problem. Project 4 should be okay now.

----------------------

This URL is the same single instance we have been using: https://ec2-54-204-78-21.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8443/cs122b-spring20-project1/

To use the AWS load balancer, follow this link: http://ec2-100-25-30-242.compute-1.amazonaws.com:80/cs122b-spring20-project1/
To use the GCP load balancer, use this one instead: http://104.154.181.201:80/cs122b-spring20-project1/

Note: the load balancer links will redirect the user to one of two other AWS instances.

I worked alone, as usual.

- # Connection Pooling
    - #### Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of using JDBC Connection Pooling.
    	
    	- project1/WebContent/META-INF/context.xml is where the JDBC Connection Pooling is configured.
    	
    	- Files that use JDBC Connection Pooling (i.e. that execute SQL queries or inserts):
    		- project1/src/main/java/AndroidMovieListServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/AndroidSingleMovieServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/BrowsePageServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/CompleteServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/CreateMovieServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/CreateStarServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/DashboardLoginServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/DescribeTableServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/LoginServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/MovieListServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/MovieSuggestionServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/PaymentServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/SearchPageServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/SingleMovieServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/SingleStarServlet.java


    - #### Explain how Connection Pooling is utilized in the Fabflix code.

    	- My version of Fabflix uses Connection Pooling to save time when processing queries to the MySQL databases. Each connection is released upon completion of the servlet's operation.
    	- All of the servlets use the MySQL database local to that AWS instance (using "localhost") except for CompleteServlet.java, CreateMovieServlet.java, and CreateStarServlet.java. 
    	  These three require write operations to be done; because they make modifications to the database, we have to ensure that those changes are reflected across all AWS instances.
    	  Thus, we have to use a connection specifically talking to the master instance. Any and all changes to the database on that instance are propagated to its slave instance (the other
    	  of the pair that are available).
    
    - #### Explain how Connection Pooling works with two backend SQL.

    	- There are two AWS instances to which the user can be redirected by the load balancer and each one houses a MySQL database identical to the other. We make sure that those MySQL
    	  databases are identical by slaving one to the other. Where Connection Pooling comes into play is that the context.xml file has two separate resources, one for read operations,
    	  which only talks to the local database (which could still be the master database if the user was assigned to that one by the load balancer), and one for write operations which
    	  is hard-coded to connect to the specific AWS instance with the master database. When a request is received, the appropriate connection is allocated (either read or write), the
    	  operation is conducted, and the connection is released so it can be used by another user connected to the server.
    

- # Master/Slave
    - #### Include the filename/path of all code/configuration files in GitHub of routing queries to Master/Slave SQL.

    	- There was no MySQL Router implemented for this project. All routing was done manually as described in the next question.

    	- project1/WebContent/META-INF/context.xml is where the JDBC Connection Pooling is configured. This is where the IP addresses of the SQL servers are specified.
    	
    	- Files that use JDBC Connection Pooling (only CompleteServlet.java, CreateMovieServlet.java, and CreateStarServlet.java are required to contact the master):
    		- project1/src/main/java/AndroidMovieListServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/AndroidSingleMovieServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/BrowsePageServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/CompleteServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/CreateMovieServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/CreateStarServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/DashboardLoginServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/DescribeTableServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/LoginServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/MovieListServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/MovieSuggestionServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/PaymentServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/SearchPageServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/SingleMovieServlet.java
    		- project1/src/main/java/SingleStarServlet.java

    - #### How read/write requests were routed to Master/Slave SQL?
    
    	- There are two Resource tags specified in context.xml. One has the name "jdbc/moviedb" and specifies connection to the local MySQL database at localhost. This resource and pool of
    	  connections is used to perform read operations. The other resource, however, has the name "jdbc/moviedb_write" and connects only to the MySQL database on the AWS instance that has
    	  the master server. So, as seen in the code, depending on which operation we want to execute, we take from either the pool of connections meant for reading or the one meant for writing.
    	  That's not to say the master server connections can't also perform read operations; it's just that they are used solely for modifying the database.

- # JMeter TS/TJ Time Logs
    - #### Instructions of how to use the `log_processing.*` script to process the JMeter logs.

	    - I did this with a Java project using Maven. I altered a freshly cloned project3-DomParser-example to make this.
	    - Just like with the DOM Parser, change directory to the time_data_parse folder, execute "mvn package", and then execute "mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="log_processing". The results
	      will print to the standard output on the terminal. Note that the file to parse must be named "time_data.txt" and in the root folder of the project. 

- # JMeter TS(Servlet time) / TJ(JDBC time) Time Measurement Report

 Note that all scaled results are from usage of the AWS load balancer, not the GCP. In case you are curious, Case 2 with the GCP load balancer had an Average Query Time of 410 ms.
 
 Also note that you need to scroll all the way to the right to see the Analysis column.

Project 4:

YouTube link: https://youtu.be/cFYqSttesQ0

Again, I worked alone.

To deploy the browser application, just follow this URL: https://ec2-54-204-78-21.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8443/cs122b-spring20-project1/

To deploy the Android application, copy the p4-android folder into the IntelliJ open window, configure properly, select the emulator of your choice (I used Pixel 3), and click "run".

I only did the fuzzy search for the Android app. It would have been a very involved and lengthy process to sift through and make changes to my source, HTML, and JS files in many places of my browser application to enable fuzzy search while also keeping the normal search available. The changes in my app were far fewer and thus induced far less headache, although I still needed to extend the timeout threshold to be thirty seconds rather than the default in order to allow it to work; the Levenshtein Edit Distance Algorithm has a very high time-complexity and the only way to really make it work quickly is to first create a list of all the keywords across all the titles and, for every movie, create a separate column detailing the edit distance for each keyword against the movie's title; this doesn't even account for combinations of keywords, like "dark knight" in addition to both "dark" and "knight". There is a serious amount of preprocessing time and indexing/storage space required to make the LEDA time-efficient.

My usage of the LEDA is quite a bit less-involved than that optimal strategy; I run the algorithm through my table for a given user input and only select the ones that have an edit distance value smaller than an integer value that dyanamically increases with the title's length: 2 if it's less than 9, else 4 if it's less than 17, else 7 if it's less than 25, else a third of the title's length if it's 25 or more; The algorithm and a commented example of its use are included in "levenshtein.sql".

More importantly, though, you don't have to use it! There is a separate button on the search page of the Android app that says "fuzzy"; this will execute the fuzzy search. If you don't want to waste some 22 seconds each time you search, stick with the button reading "search".

I also took steps to optimize the fulltext search by incorporating a short list of stop words (a, am, an, and, are, as, at, be, by, for, in, of, the, to) that are optional in the resultant movie's title. For example, searching "a dark" by title will return "A Scanner Darkly", but will also return "The Dark Knight" and, similarly, searching for "the dark" will return both "The Dark Knight" and "A Scanner Darkly". This happens because both "a" and "the" are stop words that should be considered optional.

Project 3:

YouTube link: https://youtu.be/AAnl_d9FUpI

Just like the last project, I worked on this one solo.

Task 7 SQL Statement Performance Tuning techniques:
1) I used preparedStatement.addBatch() to execute insert statements much more quickly. Now it finishes in seconds rather than hours naively.
2) I expedited the lookup process from linear time (naive) to constant time by using HashMaps to index every new star, movie, and genre along with their associated unique IDs for my database (that I assigned to them).

What follows are notes about the XML files and inconsistencies I repaired along with actual reports, all of which are found in txt files on this repo:

mains243.xml
- Some title, year, and director tags have strange characters in them. ~ and ' are common. To counter this, I replaced the
~ with a space and any ' with a backtick (`). 

- Some of the actors' names have nicknames embedded in them, e.g. Hello 'My name is' World or something similar. What
is inconsistent about these is that some of those ' have \ in front of them, making them potentially dangerous and more
error-prone. These were also replaced with backticks.

- I also found a genre (a <cat> tag's value) that had ' surounding it. These are removed.

- Some genres are variations of other genres, but are indecipherable to me:  if 'Fant' is 'Fantasy', what is 'FantH*'?
I am also guessing that "Surl" means "Surreal". I didn't bother parsing out/altering any of the incoming genre names.

- I found a case of a movie completely repeated.

actors63.xml
- The value of the <year> tag would sometimes have a ~ in front of it, so those characters were removed.

- Both ' and " are replaced with a backtick wherever they are found.

- Some of the <year> tags are just a *. I have also seen at least one case where the year was "19xx" or something similar.
I do not deal with these cases in the parser itself and instead report them to the inconsistencies file. They will be handled
by my Java operations in charge of inserting these records into the database.

casts124.xml
- There are many backslashes in this file, but they all precede either ' or ". All the backslashes are removed and both '
and " are replaced with a backtick.

- According to the DTD, the term "s a" is used when the actor's name is not known. I also found instances where the name
said "no_actor". These are all removed.

- I also found one entry in the cast list reading "midget actor". I don't think we'd want something that offensive in our 
application.

Project 2:

YouTube link: https://youtu.be/cFacsYlHPKE

Deployment on AWS:
-  In my create table statements I made for this project, I used the row_number() function and apparently MySQL 5.7 doesn't like this. I eventually found a way to get around this, but I was unable to deploy my application remotely in time; that's on me for not starting early enough. However, as you can see by my GitHub code and my demo, I fulfilled all the requirements, so I hope I can receive at least some credit. If not, then fine, whatever. At least I'm caught up and learned some new things.

Steps for deployment:
1) Run an Ubuntu 16.04 EC2 AWS instance with Maven, Java 8, MySQL 5.7, and Tomcat 8.5.53 installed. I also manually installed Java FX so I could use javafx.util.Pair; I wrote a Piazza post about this ()

1) Delete any .war files of the same name from ~/tomcat/webapps

2) Clone this Github repository to the AWS instance

3) moviedb is already primed, but I have a file there titled project2_aws_queries.sql that creates tables in moviedb that make the application run much faster (i.e remove inner joins, temp tables, subqueries, etc.)

4) Navigate to the project1/ folder in the repo (where the pom file is) and execute "mvn package" to build the .war file

5) Copy the war to ~/tomcat/webapps and make sure it's there.

6) Execute ~/tomcat/bin/startup.sh

7) Now navigate to the public DNS IP of the AWS instance at port 8080.

8) Go to the Host Manager screen on the Apache Tomcat manager home page. There should be a war file that includes "cs122b-spring20-team-90" in the name.

9) Clicking on that link takes the user to the home page and immediately redirects them to the login.html page.

Substring matching design: I just used LIKE and %, the latter of which in different ways.
-  When searching, using % around titles and directors' and stars' names was effective in getting basically everything. I didn't bother with the _ operator (that would be really difficult to code with so many possibilities; would we use it between every pair of characters or something?). Browsing was split into two different scenarios: genres had the same approach as the search parameters, but titles only had % after the letter e.g. A%, 0%, etc. The reason for this is because there was almost no telling which genres would be in the genres cell for each row, and I didn't want to exclude movies because they had more than one genre e.g. browsing through "Action" films should return "The Dark Knight" which has genres "Action", "Crime", and another I don't remember right now. "Drama"? "Thriller"? One of those, maybe.

Just like the last project, I worked on this one solo.

Project 1:

YouTube link: https://youtu.be/ljfn_pm5oGQ

As demonstrated in the video linked above, the steps to deploying the application in Tomcat are as follows:

1) Run an Ubuntu 16.04 EC2 AWS instance with Maven, Java 8, MySQL 5.7, and Tomcat 8.5.53 installed

1) Delete any .war files of the same name from ~/tomcat/webapps

2) Clone this Github repository to the AWS instance

3) Drop the moviedb table if it exists.

4) Run the SQL scripts found in project1_sql_scripts found in the repo (in my video, you can see that this folder also exists in my /home/ubuntu directory, but I don't actually use it; I only use the repo's). Make sure that the scripts are run in the following order:
	- create_table.sql
	- At this point, you could run movie-data.sql and disregard the following nine scripts, but it takes WAY longer and I didn't want to record that. The nine scripts below are just that file split apart by table.
	- insert_movies.sql
	- insert_genres.sql
	- insert_stars.sql
	- insert_genres_in_movies.sql
	- insert_stars_in_movies.sql
	- insert_creditcards.sql
	- insert_customers.sql
	- insert_sales.sql
	- insert_ratings.sql

5) Navigate to the project1/ folder in the repo (where the pom file is) and execute "mvn package" to build the .war file

6) Copy the war to ~/tomcat/webapps and make sure it's there.

7) Execute ~/tomcat/bin/startup.sh

8) Now navigate to the public DNS IP of the AWS instance at port 8080.

9) Go to the Host Manager screen on the Apache Tomcat manager home page. There should be a war file that includes "cs122b-spring20-team-90" in the name.

10) Click on that link and there you go! Now you are at the index.html of this application! PLEASE NOTE THAT THE HYPERLINK DOES NOT WORK FOR AWS DEPLOYMENT. You need to follow the directions on the page and append "movie-list" to the end of the URL to navigate there.

As for other contributors, I am working alone on the projects in this class. Team-90 is a team of one.
